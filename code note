& is a good operation.
If a method needs to compute a new class object, you should see if you can use a class
constructor to do the work. Not only does that save you trouble, it ensures that the new
object is constructed in the proper fashion.
passing by value means creating a copy of the original variable.
The default copy constructor performs a member-by-member copy of the nonstatic
members

returning an object invokes the copy constructor, whereas returning a reference doesn’t

If you don’t supply a base-class constructor in a member initializer list, the program uses the default base-class constructor.

You need to be alert to opportunities to use const.You can use it to guarantee that a
method doesn’t modify an argument:
Star::Star(const char * s) {...} // won't change the string to which s points
You can use const to guarantee that a method won’t modify the object that invokes it:
void Star::show() const {...} // won't change invoking object

There is one advantage to enums: unlike #defined names which are typically discarded
during compilation, enum names usually persist through to the debugger, and can be used while
debugging your code.

printf(pivot ? "true" : "false");
    printf("%s", pivot ? "true" : "false");
    fputs(pivot ? "true" : "false", stdout);

it is important to remember that #define only replace identifier
so it's wrong to write such code :#define EOF -1
instead it should be like this:#define EOF (-1)

#define iseven(n) ((n & 1) == 0)
